A number plate detection system using only scanned images involves a sequence of image processing steps to accurately detect and recognize vehicle number plates from static images. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the process:

1. **Image Acquisition**
Source: Obtain scanned images of vehicles, which can be in formats like JPEG, PNG, etc./
**2. Pre-processing**
Grayscale Conversion: Convert the image to grayscale to simplify processing.
Noise Reduction: Apply filters to reduce noise (e.g., Gaussian blur, median filter).
**3. Plate Detection**
Edge Detection: Use edge detection algorithms (e.g., Canny edge detection) to highlight the edges in the image.
Contour Detection: Identify contours in the image, which may represent potential number plates.
Bounding Box: Extract regions of interest (ROIs) that resemble number plates, typically using aspect ratio, size, and shape (rectangular).
**#4. Character Segmentation**
Isolate Characters: Within the detected number plate, isolate individual characters using techniques like thresholding and contour detection.
**#5. Character Recognition**
Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Recognize the segmented characters using OCR libraries such as Tesseract.
**#6. Data Storage**
Store Information: Save the detected number plate information in a structured format, like a CSV file or database
